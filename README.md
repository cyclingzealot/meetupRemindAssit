# meetupRemindAssit
Assists meetup.com organizers using the "donation per member per year" model by:
* tracking communications with members to remind them of the donation .
* Determing which member to remind according to last donation date, last communication date and last participation date.

..... and yes, I know there's a typo in the repository's name.
